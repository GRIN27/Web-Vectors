## Introduction

Welcome to Web Vectors, a simplified vulnerable website designed for educational purposes. This project aims to combine the fields of Cyber Security (Web Penetration Testing) and Full Stack Development to create a platform where students can learn about web vulnerabilities and secure coding practices. By combining website design with clear vulnerability explanations, Web Vectors serves as a valuable resource for both Computer Science and Cyber Security students.

## Features

- **Simplified Design**: Easy to understand and navigate.
- **Clear Vulnerabilities**: Each vulnerability is clearly documented and explained.
- **Educational Content**: Guides and resources for learning about web security.
- **Full Stack Development**: Includes both front-end and back-end components.
- **Modular Structure**: Easy to extend and modify for further learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- A database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- PHP installed
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP
- A read through the "Vulnerabilities.md" within the repository.

### Installation

--TO BE CHANGED LATER--

1. **Clone the Repository:**

       git clone https://github.com/Nikki-the-Parcel/Web-Vectors.git
    
2. **Move into the directory:**

       cd Web-Vectors

3. **Create a New Directory named 'Templates', and move all the Templates into it.**
   
4. **Make sure you have the reuired packages installed:**
    
    - Python3
    - flask
    - flask_sqlalchemy
    - A working Browser like Chrome, Brave, Firefox etc.
  
5. **Run the app.py**:
    
       python3 ./app.py
   
    - Ensure the web server is running.
      
6. **Access the Website**:
    
    - Open your web browser and navigate toÂ `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://{{your-network-id}}:5000/`.

## Usage

- **Navigate the Website**: Explore the different sections to understand the functionality.
- **Test Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or manual testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Learn and Fix**: Study the vulnerabilities and implement secure coding practices to fix them.

## Vulnerabilities

Web Vectors includes a variety of vulnerabilities for learning purposes. Each vulnerability is documented in the `vulnerabilities.md` file. Some examples include:

- Reflected XSS Injection
- Insecure Direct Object Referencing (IDOR)
- Hardcoding Information
- Weak Credentials
- File Inclusion
- Open Redirect

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
